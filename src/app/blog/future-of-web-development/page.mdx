## 1. Understanding Executive Risks

High-profile individuals often encounter elevated risks, including personal threats, stalking, and physical harm. In today’s unpredictable climate, executives and public figures are increasingly vulnerable to targeted incidents, whether in their professional or personal lives.

These threats can come from a range of sources, including disgruntled individuals, criminal organizations, or even politically motivated actors.
